# Predicting-House-Prices

🏡 Predicting House Prices in India — End-to-End Regression Pipeline (ML Project)
📊 A Complete, Production-Ready Machine Learning Workflow

Welcome to my machine learning project “Predicting House Prices: An End-to-End Regression Modelling Workflow” — a full industry-grade implementation of regression modelling, covering everything from baselines to regularized models and final model deployment.

This project demonstrates how real estate price prediction can be approached systematically using clean machine learning practices, fair evaluation, and model reproducibility.

🚀 Project Highlights
✔ End-to-End ML Workflow

A complete pipeline starting from:

Data cleaning & preprocessing

Exploratory baselines (mean, median, group-wise averages)

Regression modelling (SLR & MLR)

Handling multicollinearity (VIF)

Regularization (Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet)

Cross-validation (KFold, LOOCV, TimeSeriesSplit)

Residual diagnostics

Champion model selection

Exporting production-ready artifacts
